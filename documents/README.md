This repository is a public collection of scripts and programs Iâ€™ve developed to solve various problems and test different theories. The content is organized into folders based on either the parent software or the underlying programming language. The scripts cover a wide range of use cases, including automation, data processing, analysis, and more. You are welcome to reuse, modify, and distribute the code. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
